# NLP---SteamReviewAnalysis

Overview
This project aims to analyze and cluster multilingual Steam game reviews using multilingual BERT (mBERT) for word embeddings and unsupervised clustering techniques. The goal is to identify patterns in language distribution, sentiment polarity, and player engagement styles across different game reviews.

üîç Key Objectives
Text Processing & Embedding: Preprocess Steam reviews in multiple languages.
Use mBERT (Hugging Face Transformers) to generate word embeddings for clustering.
Unsupervised Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms to group reviews based on linguistic similarity and sentiment patterns.
Identify common themes across different clusters and analyze the distribution of languages in each group.
